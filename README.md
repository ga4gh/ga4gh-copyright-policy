# GA4GH Copyright Policy

The GA4GH has developed an updated version of its draft Copyright Policy. The
Copyright Policy clarifies the rights of individuals and organizations who 
contribute to GA4GH standards. It also aims to ensure the GA4GH has permission 
to adapt these contributions into standards, and to share its standards with 
users around the world. The Policy closely reflects existing GA4GH community 
practices, in order to facilitate open participation in and use of GA4GH 
standards.
