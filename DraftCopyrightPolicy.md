  <tr>
    <td>Summary of updates from Sept 2019 version:
- there are no longer copyright-based restrictions on derivatives (as this raised concerns from many people). Instead, there are now only restrictions on redistribution of derivatives that use the GA4GH trademark. 
- added clarity that the policy applies only to copyright and copyright-related rights (not patents).
- added clarity that GA4GH owns copyright in any derivative works or compilations (but contributors retain ownership of their original contribution). </td>

    3. Encourage access and uptake of GA4GH standards through clear licensing;

    4. Maintain the integrity and compatibility of GA4GH standards; 

    5. Encourage Users to extend GA4GH standards where appropriate and contribute improvements back to the GA4GH; 

    6. Recognize both organizations and individuals for their contributions to standards-development; and 

    7. Ensure consistency and coherence between this copyright policy and other GA4GH IP policies (i.e., trademark, patent).

    2. **Alternative OSS Licenses** – In some cases, GA4GH may determine that an open source license other than the Apache License is preferable for a particular item of Released Software (e.g., particular test suites).

The selected open source license terms shall be appended to the relevant Released Software release notes or otherwise made available in a prominent location.
